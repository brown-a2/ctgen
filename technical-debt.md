Use this file to track the tech debt that is too small to go into a ticket. Please prefix each task/issue with your initials. Delete any tasks/issues that have been completed, don't feel the need to re-order the numbers.

e.g.

`1. AW: Add print stylesheet`

You can tag items with priorities if you want. Normal priority should remain untagged, others should be tagged as follows:

High priority: [HP]
Low priority [LP]
Nice to have: [NTH]

## Tasks

1. AF: [LP] Rename project (Name TBD)
3. AF: Add init (creates config file) to project
4. AF: [NTH] Add basic scaffolding tool to project

## Issues

1. Init is not working. I think I'll need to sort the index.js file out to be more method based as it's in dire need of refactoring and I think it's starting to cause issues.
